# website-boilerplate
`website-boilerplate` is a boilerplate (template) for a typical basic website
[as described in the MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure).
It's supposed to make starting a website extremely easy and writer's block free; and help beginning web developers get
a feel as to what a well-laid website looks like when laid in a logical, sensible fashion.

The current scope of this project will include HTML, CSS, and Javascript: The basics of any website.
Feel free to use it for any projects you feel like, as this is freedom software, and is meant to be shared.
